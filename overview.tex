In the 2023 vol. of the College Mathematics journal, Didier Pinchon and George Stoica proposed the following problem:

\indent 
Let $x_n$ denote the number of bitstrings of length $n$ which contain neither $11$ nor $000$ as substrings. Find a recursive formula for $x_n$.

For example, for the stated restrictions, $1010010$ is a valid bitstring of length $7$, but $1100101$ is not.

We have extended this problem to find explicit and recursive equations for $x_n$ with any number and combination of restrictions. See the code for details and take a look at the web demo to try it yourself!

A paper detailing our findings is coming soon.
